'''you see attribute error reason behind is constructor that define in animal class not executed 
the constructor that was define in mammal class replaced the constructor in the base class'''
# this is what we method over riding
# print(m.age)
# print(m.weight)

# so we ll use super function to get access to the super or base class  which is this case is animal class
'''
(e.age)
(e.weight)'''

# so method overiding means replacing or extending a method define a base class without super() mammal iniit ll replace animal constructor
